# EZStorage 2

EZStorage 2 introduces a storage system that scales and evolves as players progress. Want to put 100,000 Cobblestone in 1 slot? No problem. Blocks in the mod can add a search bar, a crafting grid, additional storage, external access, security, and more. Also includes JEI integration for 1-click crafting from the system's internal inventory!

## Project Status

This repository contains EZStorage 2 updated for **Minecraft 1.21.1** and **NeoForge 21.1.77**. 

✅ **Current Status**: The mod has been successfully updated to modern NeoForge with a working registration system and basic block/item/entity structure.

### What's Working
- ✅ Builds successfully with Gradle 8.10.2
- ✅ Compatible with Minecraft 1.21.1
- ✅ Uses NeoForge 21.1.77 with ModDevGradle 2.0.46-beta
- ✅ Modern registration system with DeferredRegister
- ✅ Basic blocks: Storage Box, Storage Core
- ✅ Basic items: Key, Dolly (basic & super), Block Items
- ✅ Block entities: Storage Core Block Entity
- ✅ GUI system: Storage Core menu and screen
- ✅ Storage system: Basic inventory with insert/extract logic
- ✅ Networking: Storage sync packets for client-server communication
- ✅ JEI integration: Basic recipe transfer for crafting
- ✅ Multiblock structures: Core scanning and validation system
- ✅ Assets: Recipes, language files, loot tables, and block tags
- ✅ Unit tests for core constants
- ✅ Mod loads successfully in development environment

### What Needs Work
- ❌ Advanced JEI features (ingredient lookup from storage)

The original 1.12.2 source code has been preserved in `src/main/java-backup/` for reference during the porting process.

## Requirements

- **Java 21** or higher (required for NeoForge)
- **Gradle 8.x** (wrapper included)

## Building the Mod

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zerofall/EZStorage2.git

2. **Build the mod**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```
   
   On Windows:
   ```cmd
   gradlew.bat build

## Contributing

This mod is in active development for the 1.21.1 update. The registration foundation is complete and ready for feature implementation. Key areas that need work:

1. **Storage Logic** - Port storage system from 1.12.2 codebase
2. **GUI System** - Port all user interfaces to modern Minecraft
3. **Networking** - Update packet system for NeoForge
4. **Assets** - Create models, textures, and blockstates
5. **JEI Integration** - Restore JEI compatibility
6. **Multiblock Logic** - Port storage multiblock system
