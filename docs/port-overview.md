- **GUI System** - Modern container/screen architecture with proper layouts and interactions
- **Networking** - Client-server synchronization with custom packets
- **JEI Integration** - Recipe transfer, ingredient lookup, and R/U key support (v19.27.0.336)
- **Crafting Box** - 3x3 crafting grid with storage system integration and auto-repopulation
- **Asset System** - Complete textures, models, recipes, and language files
- **Tiered Storage** - 7 storage tiers with progressive upgrade paths (all textures working)
- **Click Interactions** - Full support for left-click, right-click, shift-click, and drag-and-drop
- **UI Synchronization** - Real-time updates for all storage operations
- **Capacity Updates** - Dynamic capacity display when multiblock changes
- **Security Box** - Player access control with whitelist management and operator override
