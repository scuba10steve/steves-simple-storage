- **Comprehensive Logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **New Package Structure** - Migrated to `io.github.scuba10steve.ezstorage`

## Major Changes from 1.12.2

### Build System Migration
- **Old**: ForgeGradle with Java 8
- **New**: ModDevGradle 2.0.46-beta with Java 21
- **Gradle**: Updated from 4.x to 8.10.2

### Registration System Overhaul
- **Old**: Registry events and manual registration
- **New**: DeferredRegister pattern with type safety
- **Benefits**: Cleaner code, better error handling, modern practices

### GUI System Modernization
- **Old**: GuiContainer and Container classes
- **New**: AbstractContainerScreen and AbstractContainerMenu
- **Changes**: Updated method signatures, modern event handling

### Networking Updates
- **Old**: SimpleNetworkWrapper with IMessage
- **New**: CustomPacketPayload with StreamCodec
- **Benefits**: Type-safe serialization, better performance

### Asset Structure Changes
- **Texture Paths**: `textures/blocks/` → `textures/block/` (singular)
- **Language Files**: `.lang` → `.json` format
- **Models**: Updated texture references for new path structure

## Development Timeline

The port was completed through systematic implementation of each major system:

1. **Foundation** - Build system and basic registration
2. **Core Systems** - Storage, GUI, and block entities  
3. **Networking** - Client-server communication
4. **Integration** - JEI and multiblock systems
5. **Assets** - Textures, recipes, and language files
6. **Polish** - Bug fixes, testing, and documentation

## Technical Highlights

### Storage Capacity Scaling
- **Basic Storage Box**: 10,000 items
- **Condensed**: 40,000 items (4x increase)
- **Super**: 160,000 items (4x increase)
- **Ultra**: 640,000 items (4x increase)
- **Hyper**: 2,560,000 items (4x increase)

### Multiblock Network Detection
- Automatic scanning of connected storage blocks
- Dynamic capacity calculation based on network size
- Support for complex multiblock structures

### Modern GUI Architecture
- 54 storage slots (6 rows × 9 columns)
- Drag & drop item insertion
- Shift-click inventory management
- Proper layout positioning for all screen sizes

## Compatibility

### Minecraft Versions
- **Target**: 1.21.1 (primary)
- **NeoForge**: 21.1.77
- **JEI**: 19.19.6.233

### Development Environment
- **Java**: 21 (required)
- **Gradle**: 8.10.2
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse recommended

## Future Considerations

The port provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

- **Additional Storage Tiers** - Easy to add new tiers with higher capacities
- **New Multiblock Components** - Framework supports crafting boxes, sorting boxes, etc.
- **Enhanced JEI Features** - Advanced ingredient lookup and recipe integration
- **Performance Optimizations** - Large-scale storage network optimizations

## Conclusion

The EZStorage 2 port successfully modernizes the beloved storage mod for current Minecraft versions while maintaining all original functionality and adding modern improvements. The codebase is well-structured, thoroughly tested, and ready for production use.
